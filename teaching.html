        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          My teaching is organized around the conviction that philosophical inquiry is most effective when it is <em>experiential</em>&mdash;when students engage with ideas through structured practical activity rather than passive reception. I design assignments that embed philosophical reflection in concrete contexts: attending film screenings, reading in communal settings, and working directly with the technologies under philosophical examination. The aim is to cultivate habits of careful analysis and argumentation that extend beyond the classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I teach across the philosophy curriculum, from introductory surveys to specialized topics in applied ethics and philosophy of technology. My background in engineering allows me to ground abstract philosophical questions in concrete technical realities, particularly when addressing topics in AI and emerging technologies. I am committed to making philosophical practice accessible and rigorous for students at every level of preparation.

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Introduction to Philosophy</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Introductory</div>
          <p>
            A first encounter with philosophical thinking through enduring questions about knowledge, reality, free will, and the nature of mind. The course emphasizes close reading of primary texts and developing the skills of philosophical argumentation. Students learn to identify assumptions, construct arguments, and engage charitably with positions they find counterintuitive.
          </p>
          <div class="assignment-highlight">
            <strong>Featured assignment:</strong> The &ldquo;philosophy reading ritual&rdquo;&mdash;students borrow a philosophy book from the library and read it in a communal space like a coffee shop, reflecting on how the setting shapes their engagement with philosophical ideas.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Introduction to Ethics</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Introductory</div>
          <p>
            An introduction to moral philosophy through classical and contemporary frameworks: virtue ethics, deontology, consequentialism, and care ethics. The course moves between theoretical foundations and practical application, asking students to reason carefully about what they owe to others and why.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Contemporary Moral Issues</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Intermediate</div>
          <p>
            An issues-driven course examining contested moral questions in light of philosophical frameworks. Topics may include the ethics of AI and automation, climate justice, free speech, economic inequality, and emerging biotechnologies. Students develop the ability to analyze positions they initially find persuasive and to articulate positions they find uncomfortable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Medical Ethics</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Intermediate</div>
          <p>
            An examination of ethical questions arising in medical practice and healthcare policy, including informed consent, end-of-life care, resource allocation, reproductive technologies, and the ethics of clinical research. The course draws on both philosophical theory and concrete cases to cultivate practical moral reasoning in clinical and policy contexts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Philosophy Through Movies</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Special Topics</div>
          <p>
            This course uses cinema as a vehicle for philosophical inquiry, treating film not as illustration of pre-existing ideas but as a medium capable of generating its own philosophical insights. Students analyze how narrative structure, visual composition, and the experience of spectatorship raise questions about personal identity, perception, free will, and the nature of reality.
          </p>
          <div class="assignment-highlight">
            <strong>Featured assignment:</strong> Students attend a film screening in a movie theater and write a reflection on how the communal, immersive experience of theatrical viewing differs from watching at home&mdash;and what this reveals about how we encounter and process ideas.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Minds and Machines: An Introduction to Philosophy of Cognitive Science</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Intermediate</div>
          <p>
            An examination of foundational questions in cognitive science through the lens of philosophy of mind: What is the relationship between minds and brains? Can machines think? What role does the body play in cognition? The course surveys classical computational theories of mind alongside embodied, enactive, and dynamical alternatives, and evaluates their implications for understanding both biological and artificial intelligence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="course-card">
          <h3>Philosophy of Video Games</h3>
          <div class="course-level">Special Topics</div>
          <p>
            An exploration of philosophical questions raised by and within video games: the nature of agency in interactive media, the ethics of virtual action, questions of identity in avatar-mediated experience, and the aesthetics of games as an art form. The course takes games seriously as objects of philosophical analysis while also using them as provocations for broader questions about choice, responsibility, and meaning.
