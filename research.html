      <!-- Overview -->
      <section class="research-overview">
        <p>
          My research asks a deceptively simple question: <em>how do agents develop understanding through systematic inquiry?</em> I pursue this across three connected domains. In philosophy of science, I argue that scientific progress is best understood through an operative lens that takes engineering, instrumentation, and material practice seriously&mdash;not merely as applications of theory, but as epistemic achievements in their own right. In AI and philosophy of mind, I examine how philosophical concepts like attention and higher-order thought are repurposed within computational systems, and what we risk when the migration goes unexamined. In the history of philosophy of science, I trace how thinkers like William Whewell and Rudolf Carnap navigated the tension between conceptual frameworks and empirical discovery&mdash;a tension that remains live today.
        </p>
        <p>
          These lines of inquiry converge on a single conviction: that understanding how knowledge is <em>made</em>&mdash;built, calibrated, revised through material engagement&mdash;matters as much as understanding how it is justified. My dual background in philosophy and robotics engineering informs this commitment at every level.

        <h3>Scientific Progress &amp; Engineering Epistemology</h3>
        <p>
          My dissertation, <em>Engineering Progress in Science</em> (University of Cincinnati, 2025), develops what I call an <strong>operative account of scientific progress</strong>. Traditional accounts emphasize theoretical discovery&mdash;new laws, explanations, or true beliefs. My account challenges this by arguing that scientific works, including models, instruments, calibration routines, and experimental systems, are epistemically significant achievements comparable to theoretical developments. Progress, on this view, involves the systematic expansion of practical and operative capacities alongside intellectual understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          This framework reframes engineering not as applied science but as a form of inquiry that generates its own distinctive knowledge. By treating the material construction and calibration of scientific instruments as cognitive achievements, the operative account reveals dimensions of scientific practice that standard philosophies of progress overlook.

        <h3>Conceptual Foundations of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
          A second strand of my work examines how philosophical vocabulary migrates into AI research&mdash;and what is distorted in the process. My paper &ldquo;AI Attention is Not Higher-Order Thought&rdquo; (in progress) analyzes how transformer attention mechanisms differ fundamentally from the philosophical and cognitive-scientific concepts they borrow from. When AI researchers speak of &ldquo;attention,&rdquo; they invoke a term with deep roots in philosophy of mind and consciousness studies, yet the computational mechanism bears only superficial resemblance to its conceptual source.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work leverages my dual training: an M.Eng. in Robotics Engineering (2024) alongside my philosophical research. I am interested in how conceptual engineering can clarify the foundations of AI, and in what the philosophy of mind can and cannot contribute to understanding artificial systems.

        <h3>Whewell, Carnap, and the Conceptual Architecture of Science</h3>
        <p>
          My historical work focuses on how past philosophers of science conceptualized the relationship between conceptual change and empirical inquiry. I have particular interests in William Whewell&rsquo;s philosophy of induction and discovery, and in Rudolf Carnap&rsquo;s logical frameworks and their implications for conceptual engineering. This historical research is not antiquarian; it illuminates contemporary debates by recovering resources that have been underappreciated or misread.

        <div class="pub-abstract">
          This article reframes public engagement with science as a cognitively generative practice rather than a merely ethical obligation. Drawing on resources from philosophy of science and epistemology, I argue that outreach and public-facing work can function as a form of inquiry that reshapes researchers' own understanding of their fields. The paper develops this claim through case studies in which engagement activities led to genuine conceptual revision.

        <div class="pub-abstract">
          This dissertation develops an operative account of scientific progress that foregrounds practical cognition, material construction, and engineering alongside traditional intellectual reasoning. I argue that scientific works&mdash;including instruments, models, calibration routines, and experimental systems&mdash;are epistemically significant achievements that standard accounts of progress overlook. The framework reveals how engineering practices generate distinctive forms of knowledge and contribute to scientific progress on their own terms.
